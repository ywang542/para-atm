# Note: GnatsEnvironment is implemented as a class wtih static methods.
# The same effect could be achieved using globally defined functions
# and state variables, but the class is used in order to provide some
# organization and encapuslation.
#
# Implementation of these utilities was challenging because the JVM
# and GNATS servers can only be started once.  After they are stopped,
# they cannot be started again within the same Python process.  This
# is why we need global (static) variables to track the state and trap
# conditions that would otherwise lead to crashes.
#
# Other approaches that were considered: Use of a context manager
# class was considered, which is nice because it clearly delineates
# where in the code the environment is valid and will handle shtudown
# once the context exits.  The problem is that the JVM can't be
# started again, so only one such context instatiation would be
# allowed.  A regular class was also considered (not using static
# methods and state), but there is the same issue: since the JVM
# cannot be restarted, only once such instance could be created.

        This function is called automatically by
        :py:class:`GnatsSimulationWrapper`, so normally there is no
        need for the user to call it directly.

        If the JVM is already running, this will do nothing.  If the
        JVM has already been stopped, this will raise an error, since
        it cannot be restarted.

        This function takes care of setting the Java classpath,
        changing directories, starting the JVM, and starting the GNATS
        standalone server.

        References to gnatsStandalone as well as other interface
        objects, which are normally available via the GNATS header
        file, are stored as attributes of the class.

        Path issues with GNATS are handled behind the scenes by setting
        the classpath and changing directories prior to starting the
        JVM.  The original directory is remembered, and it is restored
        after the JVM is stopped.
